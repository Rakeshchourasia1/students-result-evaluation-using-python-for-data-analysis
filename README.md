## Student Records Analysis

### Overview

This project aims to analyze student records to uncover insights into academic performance and the impact of factors such as gender, parental education, and ethnic background. The analysis uses Python, focusing on data manipulation and visualization to identify key trends and patterns.

### Features

- **Data Loading and Exploration**:
  - Import student data from a CSV file.
  - Display summary statistics and dataset information.
  - Identify and handle missing data points.

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Remove unnecessary columns.
  - Standardize and clean data fields, such as weekly study hours.

- **Visual Analysis**:
  - Visualize gender distribution using count plots.
  - Analyze the impact of parental education on student scores with group statistics and heatmaps.
  - Examine the effect of parents' marital status on student scores.
  - Display score distributions (Math, Reading, Writing) using box plots.
  - Show the distribution of ethnic groups with pie charts and count plots.

### Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

### Getting Started
